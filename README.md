<i>Internet Radio.  Old school charm.  New school moves.</i>

Here's another one that's not fully baked yet.  Ok, it's not even mixed yet.  Ok, it doesn't even have all of it's ingredients yet.

I've run across a couple examples of RasPi based internet radio appliances.  Very cool.  They all seem to have custom, 3D printed enclosures.  I don't have a 3D printer.  Not so cool.

My youngest son likes to listen to the radio as he falls asleep and likes having an alarm clock (he doesn't have a smart phone yet, so he rocks his alarms old-school).  He's had a good old-fashioned transistor radio. And a slightly less old-fashioned clock-radio. It might be time for something more modern....

Need to noodle on this one.  Should be a relatively simple project though.
